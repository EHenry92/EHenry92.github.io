        {/* <p>
        My name is Evlis Henry. I am a full-stack developer. I began my journey into programming as an undergraduate at Hunter College. However, after graduating, I decided to follow my passion for education and became a middle school math teacher.  </p>
      <p>
        After a couple years of educating young minds, I realized that my heart belonged to coding.I polished my programming skills by attending Grace Hopper Academy- an all female coding boot camp. There, I became fully immersed into full-stack Javascript. </p>
      <p>
        I aspire to continue helping people as a software engineer.

        Hi, I'm Evlis Henry. My background is in Education and Computer Science, and after a couple of years of educating young minds, I've shifted my focus into developing, designing and maintaining tools to help others. When I'm not coding or solving logic puzzles, I enjoy exploring haunted houses, surviving escape rooms and reading thrillers.
