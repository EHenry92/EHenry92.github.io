        <p>
          I began my journey into programming as an undergrad at Hunter College. However, after graduating, I decided to follow my passion for education and became a middle school math teacher.</p>
      <p>
        After a couple years of educating young minds, I realized that my heart belonged to coding.I polished my programming skills by attending Grace Hopper Academy- an all female coding boot camp. There, I became fully immersed into full-stack Javascript. </p>
      <p>
        I aspire to continue helping people as a software engineer.
