        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
        My name is Evlis Henry. I am a full-stack Javascript developer. I began my journey into programming as an undergraduate at Hunter College. However, after graduating, I decided to follow my passion for education and became a middle school math teacher.  </p>
      <p>
        After a couple years of educating young minds, I realized that my heart belonged to coding.I polished my programming skills by attending Grace Hopper Academy- an all female coding boot camp. There, I became fully immersed into Full-Stack Javascript. </p>
      <p>
        I aspire to continue contributing to education as a developer.
